I have created Django project named Student-management using the following command:
       django-admin startproject student_management
And I have create a Django app named "students" using the following command:
       python manage.py startapp students
After this, I have defined the Student model in the models.py file of the students app.
Then created a serializer class in the serializers.py file of the students app.
Next, I have created the views(views.py) for the API endpoints requiremnts for students app.
